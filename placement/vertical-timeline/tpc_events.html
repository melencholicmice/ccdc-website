				<p style="align:center;"><img src="tpc_activity_files/Dr_Desh-P.jpg" /></p>
				<p><span style="color:#2980b9"><u><em><strong>Coming back from COVID: Learnings and Lessons for Employability and Entrepreneurship</strong></em></u></span></p>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">Training and Placement Cell (TPC) and Entrepreneurship Cell of Indian Institute of Technology Patna organized a live webinar focusing on <strong>&lsquo;Coming back from COVID-19: Learning and Lessons for Education and Entrepreneurship&rsquo;</strong> by Hon&rsquo;ble Dr Anand Deshpande, Founder, Chairman and Managing Director for Persistent System, in line with ongoing weekend webinars by eminent personalities from Industry to share their journeys, knowledge and various opportunities to overcome challenges in these difficult times. This ensures that students remain informed, updated, and motivated during the unprecedented era of uncertainty and health crisis.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">IIT Patna TPC Cell Officer Kripa Shankar Singh welcomed our distinguished guest speaker and set the agenda of the webinar. The session began with Dr Deshpande sharing his illustrious career and inspired the attendees with his encouraging outlook. He insisted that the students of this eminent institution should have a positive perspective on this pandemic, calling this as a short glitch in an overall long and acclaimed journey ahead. He also talked about how this crisis could be advantageous for many and how one from a technological background could help himself to learn, grow, and get the most out of it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">One of the other agenda which sir focused on was entrepreneurship and how one should approach startups to grow it into a successful corporation. He talked about two important things namely,</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: square; padding-left:25px; line-height:22px;">
	<li>Learning how to learn</li>
	<li>Networking</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align:justify;">as the cornerstones of a triumphant entrepreneur. He said that being nimble, agile and brave enough to face failures are important aspects of any startups. He gave various examples from his own journey as well as from technological hubs such as silicon valley, to advise that failures should not be seen as something to be sad and sorry about, but should be learning points for better growth. He also named a few areas such as health systems and various supply chain management which could be the inception areas for various startups and budding businesses, other than technology. According to him, students should:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: square; padding-left:25px; line-height:22px;">
	<li>Choosing a problem which can be solved and sold; which according to him is the most important aspect of a start-up venture</li>
	<li>Building a team with passionate people.</li>
	<li>Not to focus entirely on the monetary part</li>
	<li>Partnering with other start-ups (in case one doesn&rsquo;t have the required background to start a venture)</li>
	<li>Think big: Great goals are achievable only if one thinks big.</li>
	<li>Learn how to learn: Best time to diversify one&rsquo;s field.</li>
	<li>Be Persistent: Makes the difference between a winner and a loser</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &ldquo;Start-ups are a journey rather than a destination &amp; failures are an integral part of that journey&rdquo;. Failure should be looked at as a learning experience. On his DeAsra foundation, he said that it is a way of giving back to the society and it has helped around 80,000 start-ups to stand on their feet.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Later on, when he was asked how he tackled and steered his company as a leader in the difficult time of 2008 Financial Recession, he replied that one should be humble enough to accept that such tortuous events have no right answers or correct response. He conveyed his belief that in such unprecedented times, <strong>&lsquo;People don&rsquo;t value transaction, but value relations&rsquo;</strong>. He said he lived by the same code and this helped him in several difficult events and helped him build a giant of a corporation that Persistent system is today. Speaking on Persistent which started in 1990 and is now based in 18 different countries, he said it had a 3500 crore revenue in the previous financial year.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered several questions raised by panellists as well as the attendees, to make this an inspiring, engaging, and informative talk. <strong>Dr. Jose Parambil</strong>, PIC Training and Placement proposed vpte of thanks and concluded the session.
